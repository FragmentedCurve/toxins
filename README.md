# Toxins

The Toxins repository is a collection of small utilities, mostly written in C
or C++, that use toxcore. The number of dependencies these tools have is very
small, so they don't need complicated build systems. It's a strict requirement
that the tool must be compiled with a single command line, and the execution
does not require much setup. The number of source files should also be small,
ideally 1 or 2.

If you have a utility you'd like to see included here, feel free to send a
[Pull Request](https://github.com/TokTok/toxins/compare).
